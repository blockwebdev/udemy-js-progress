Jonas Schmedtmann Udemy/PACKT-The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert/Coursera META Full Stack,

Currently using this course as a base filler along with various other study materials,
all code will be in one single file and will be updated frequently. 

The code will include various comments, some test model examples of my own as well as
brainstorming ideas to help strengthen my knowledge of the language. This is not expected 
to be super clean code right away but as I progress through the course, improvement should
be evident.
